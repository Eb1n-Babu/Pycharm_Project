"""Alright, let's step it up a notch! Here's a more challenging object-oriented programming question that integrates inheritance,
encapsulation, and method overriding:

"Design a Python class named Person with attributes for name and age. Implement a method to display details. Then,
create a subclass Student that inherits from Person and adds attributes for grades. Implement methods to add a grade,
calculate the average grade, and override the display method to include student-specific details. Demonstrate the functionality by creating instances and interacting with the methods."

This question introduces:

Inheritance (extending Person to create Student).

Encapsulation (managing grades inside the class).

Method overriding (modifying the inherited display_details method)."""

✔ Module: Lowercase, words separated by underscores (_) for clarity. Example: student.py, math_operations.py

✔ Class: PascalCase, capitalize each word with no underscores. Example: Student, DataProcessor, EmployeeRecord
